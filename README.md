# Git & GitHub MasterClass

## About this project

Add real world development team skills for version control and source control to your resume and programming arsenal

## Description

Git is the most used version control system for programmers in the world. GitHub, with 57 million repositories projects and 28 million users is the largest host of source code in the world.
The reality is, developers of all levels need to have a mastery of these tools. 

Why?

Firstly, because employers are demanding these skills.  Developers who don't know Git and GitHub have less opportunities available to them because so many companies are using one or both of these technologies.

Secondly, if you don't know how to use this technology you literally won't be able to function as a programmer anywhere that version control is used.  And that's most companies! Don't get left behind!
